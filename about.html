    <p class="p3"><i>In a corner, dim-lit, where the shadows fall,A singer strums, and the notes recall the whispers of winds, the hum of the sea,
        A tale untold, wild and free</i></p>
    <p class="p4"><i>Fingers dance upon silver strings,Each pluck a story, each strum it sings.The guitar hums like an old, dear friend,
        Together they weave songs that never end</i></p>
        <p class="p5"><i>His voice, a river, flows soft and low,
            Through valleys of sorrow, where melodies grow.
            And in the echoes of the chords he plays,
            The night turns to music in endless ways.</i></p>
            <p class="p6"><i> soul unburdened, he lets it fly,
                As the guitar lifts his heart to the sky.
                For in every note, in each refrain,
                The singer finds peace, again and again</i></p>
